# ⚡ lumigrid-node-acrelay: Control AC Devices! ⚡

Welcome to the lumigrid-node-acrelay repository! 🚀 This is where the code lives for the ESP32-powered AC Relay/Dimmer Node, designed to control AC-powered devices. Get ready to automate your home or projects! 🏠

This node is part of the LumiGrid ecosystem, brought to you by Cube & Reclame Fabriek, with development led by DevSlavDev.

## 📂 What's Inside?

This repository contains the code and resources for the AC Relay/Dimmer Node:

* `app/`:  Source code for the ESP32 firmware (C++ with ESP-IDF). This handles AC device control and communication. 💻
* `web/`:  Node-specific web UI components for controlling AC devices and configuring the node. 💅
* `config/`:  Default configuration files for the AC Relay/Dimmer Node. ⚙️
* `scripts/`:  Scripts for building and deploying the firmware to the ESP32. 🛠️
* `README.md`:  That's me! 👋 Your guide to this repository.

## ✨ Features

* Controls AC devices with on/off functionality. [cite: 31]
* Provides AC dimming capabilities. [cite: 31]
* Offers a web interface and REST API for control. [cite: 32]

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Clone this repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/DevSlavDev/lumigrid-node-acrelay.git](https://github.com/DevSlavDev/lumigrid-node-acrelay.git)
    cd lumigrid-node-acrelay
    ```

2.  **Set up your ESP32 development environment:** You'll need the ESP-IDF framework.

3.  **Explore the code in the `app/` directory.**

4.  **Build and flash the firmware to your ESP32.**

5.  **Connect your AC devices to the node.** ⚠️ **(Safety first! Work with AC power carefully.)**

6.  **Use the web UI to control your devices!**

## 🤝 Contributing
